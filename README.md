# Library-Management-System
Digitally write the issues of book  and calculate fines if someone takes it for more than 7 days.
The environment is semi-graphical. Use keys to hover over the options.
You can add books, get details of it any time(total, in stock, trending).
The user can add the number of books too.
The management allows to issue the book for 7 days without fine and thereafter takes fine for it.
The fines are calculated separately for each month even the leap year days aren't ignored.
There are several constraints like the user cannot enter the submission date before issuing date, total stock cannot be in negative.
Any many more which you'll know using the project.
